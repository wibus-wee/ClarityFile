# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a command palette (command box) feature for the ClarityFile desktop application. The command palette will provide users with a unified interface for quick navigation, file search, and extensible plugin-based functionality, inspired by modern command interfaces like Raycast, Vercel, and Linear.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to quickly access the command palette with a keyboard shortcut, so that I can efficiently navigate and search without using the mouse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user presses Cmd+K (macOS) or Ctrl+K (Windows/Linux) THEN the system SHALL display the command palette overlay
2. WHEN the command palette is open AND the user presses Escape THEN the system SHALL close the command palette
3. WHEN the command palette is open AND the user clicks outside the palette THEN the system SHALL close the command palette
4. WHEN the command palette opens THEN the system SHALL focus the search input field automatically

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search for application routes and pages using flexible matching, so that I can navigate quickly using either Chinese characters, pinyin, or English terms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user types in the search input THEN the system SHALL match against page titles, route paths, and pinyin representations
2. WHEN the user types English characters THEN the system SHALL match against route paths and English translations
3. WHEN the user types Chinese characters THEN the system SHALL match against page titles and Chinese content
4. WHEN the user types pinyin THEN the system SHALL match against pinyin representations of Chinese page titles
5. WHEN a route match is selected THEN the system SHALL navigate to that route and close the command palette

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search for files when no built-in commands match my query, so that I can find documents even when I don't remember exact filenames.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enters a search term that doesn't match any built-in commands THEN the system SHALL display "Use '[query]' with..." section
2. WHEN the "Use with..." section is displayed THEN the system SHALL show available search plugins that can handle the query
3. WHEN the user selects a search plugin THEN the system SHALL enter the plugin detail view within the command palette
4. WHEN in plugin detail view THEN the system SHALL execute the search using the original query as the search parameter
5. WHEN file search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL support fuzzy matching against file titles

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access my favorite commands quickly, so that I can perform frequent actions without typing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the command palette opens with empty search THEN the system SHALL display favorite commands at the top
2. WHEN the user right-clicks or uses a keyboard shortcut on a command THEN the system SHALL provide an option to add/remove from favorites
3. WHEN the user adds a command to favorites THEN the system SHALL persist this preference across sessions
4. WHEN the user removes a command from favorites THEN the system SHALL update the favorites list immediately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see suggested commands based on my usage patterns, so that I can discover and access relevant functionality efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the command palette opens with empty search THEN the system SHALL display recently used commands below favorites
2. WHEN the user executes a command THEN the system SHALL track usage frequency and recency
3. WHEN displaying suggestions THEN the system SHALL prioritize commands based on usage frequency and recency
4. WHEN the user hasn't used the system much THEN the system SHALL show default suggested commands

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create plugins for the command palette, so that I can extend functionality in a modular way.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a plugin is registered THEN the system SHALL make it available in the command palette
2. WHEN a plugin defines search capabilities THEN the system SHALL include it in "Use with..." suggestions
3. WHEN a plugin is executed THEN the system SHALL provide the necessary context and callbacks
4. WHEN a plugin renders its interface THEN the system SHALL display it within the command palette container
5. IF a plugin fails to load THEN the system SHALL continue functioning without that plugin

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access the Themes Studio plugin through the command palette, so that I can manage and switch application themes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user searches for "theme", "主题", or "Themes Studio" THEN the system SHALL show the Themes Studio plugin in results
2. WHEN the user selects the Themes Studio plugin THEN the system SHALL enter the plugin detail view within the command palette
3. WHEN in Themes Studio plugin view THEN the system SHALL display the plugin's interface for theme management
4. WHEN the user interacts with theme options in the plugin THEN the system SHALL apply changes and maintain the command palette open for further interaction
5. WHEN the Themes Studio plugin is available for search queries THEN the system SHALL include it in "Use with..." suggestions for theme-related searches

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure which plugins appear in search suggestions, so that I can customize the command palette to my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses settings THEN the system SHALL provide a command palette configuration section
2. WHEN in command palette settings THEN the system SHALL allow enabling/disabling plugins for search suggestions
3. WHEN the user changes plugin settings THEN the system SHALL update the "Use with..." suggestions accordingly
4. WHEN the user reorders plugins THEN the system SHALL respect the order in search suggestions
